Dear students,
The data set, related to the semester project, and the description of the attributes are uploaded (check the announcements for further details).

There are three tasks for the semestral project, such that:
Develop a prediction model (classification and/or regression);
Cluster the instances;
Provide some ideas on how frequent pattern mining could be utilized to uncover some patterns in the data and/or to enhance the prediction.
 

You have to write a report, in LaTEX, of 8 to 10 pages in Springer LNCS style about your work and the results achieved. 
The template for the project can be found via this link (Links to an external site.)

You have to upload a zip file into Canvas named as: [student's full name]-[Neptun Code].zip, and that contains: 
The prepared report (in pdf format);
The related program source codes.

The deadline for uploading the files (the report and program source codes) is December, 10th.  2021, 11:59pm. Please note that this is a strict deadline! 
(meaning that after that time no submission will be considered)

Please, keep in mind that, during the evaluation, emphasis will be put on various steps you were employing during your project and, thus, 
the final accuracy achieved would not be the most important issue (so, you don't need to use fancy deep learning models).
 

Best regards,
Farou Zakarya
